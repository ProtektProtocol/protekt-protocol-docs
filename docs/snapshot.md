# Protekt Snapshot

Protekt Protocol will use [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/) to enable our community of stakeholders to efficiently make decisions about the project. Community members can make proposals, which are voted on by token holders. To keep things lightweight and efficient, Snapshot does not require decisions to be made on chain, only requiring digital signatures for votes. 

Our Snapshot page is being built - when we launch it we will have more information here about how to get involved with the Protekt community.
