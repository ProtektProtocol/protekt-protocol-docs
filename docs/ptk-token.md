# The PTK Token
The PTK token is the governance and rewards token of the Protekt Protocol. It will be used to stake for assuming protocol liability, make governance decisions, receive rewards from protocol fees, provided as protocol incentives, and used to fund grants and audit reports for DeFi protocols that are covered by Protekt.

## PKT Token Supply
Upon launch, 100 million (100,000,000) PTK tokens will be minted. The supply will not be frozen initially until the community votes on the mechanism to freeze or alter supply. For instance, minting more tokens might remain to cover large losses in insured protocols, if the Protekt community votes it in.

The majority of the PTK tokens will be dispersed to the community that contribute work and capital to grow the protocol.

### Supply Percentages
* 60% - Community (Work & Capital)
* 20% - Team Members (with 4 year vesting)
* 10% - Partners & Advisors (with 4 year vesting)
* 10% - Investors (if applicable)

## Earning PTK Tokens
PTK tokens can be earned by contributing capital (liquidity mining) and work (completing tasks, documentation, development, translations, etc.). For a full overview of contributing, check out the [Contributions & Rewards Page](./contributions-and-rewards.md).
